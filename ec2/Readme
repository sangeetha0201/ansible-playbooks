For working on Ansible we need to first set up a few things,

* AWS user account
* Ansible
* Python
* Boto

To create an EC2 instance using Ansible, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. Create an AWS account and obtain your access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) to authenticate your Ansible control machine with AWS.

2. Install and configure the AWS CLI on your Ansible control machine.
